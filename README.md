# Password Generator 

The purpose of this project was to build familiarity with the foundations of JavaScript by writing code that would allow a user to create a randomly generated password. I achieved this goal by using prompts and confirms to gather input from the user and then using that input to randomly generate a password that met the selected criteria.
