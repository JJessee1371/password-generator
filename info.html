        <h1>Your Password Safety</h1>
        <p>One of the most widely used methods of authenticating ourselves, or proving we are who we say we are is 
            through the use of a username and password. Is your password strong enough to deter hackers? What are 
            good practices to follow? This page will aim to give you a better understanding of how criminals will
            attempt to gain access to your accounts and how you can fight back!

        <h2>Password Attacks and How to Defend Yourself</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Brute Force</h3>
            <p>This method of attack is not a highly sophisticated one, but if you fail to follow proper guidelines
                it can still prove incredibly effective. When choosing to brute force a password, the attacker is simply
                going to guess every possible password until they get the right one. A massive list of possible passwords
                can be generated by an attack in less than a few minutes, depending on how many character types are included
                in the password and how long it is. The attacker can then automate either one computer or many to begin 
                trying each and every password from their generated list. It is important that we do not underestimate the
                patience of the bad actors that choose this technique.
            </p>
            <h4>Preventitive Measures</h4>
            <p>Lucky for you these attempts to breach your account can be quickly defeated! There are two main factors that will
                make your password so difficult to guess it will deter an attacker: length and variety. It is imperative that you 
                include a lower case letter, an upper case letter, a number, and a special character in every one of your passwords.
                By adding in new character types, it greatly expands the number of possibilities that need to be exhausted. For instance, 
                by adding even a single upper case letter to an all lower case password, each possible character choice now numbers 52 instead
                of 26. Your password should be a minimum of 8 total characters long, but aim for longer to achieve the best results. One final 
                measure that can be taken is to set an account lockout after so many failed attempts have taken place. Doing so vastly increases 
                the effort required to crack the password.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Password Spraying</h3>
            <p>This method is closely related to brute force attacks. While a brute force attack focuses on a single account or system, the goal
                of password spraying is to attempt to access many different accounts or systems. The attacker will compile a list of the most 
                commonly used passwords and attempt it on every possible account they have access to in the hopes that it will breach one of them. 
                Having many systems to choose from ensures that the account lockout timers have the opportunity to run down before coming back for 
                another pass if they have been triggered at all. The situation in which this attack becomes the most dangerous is in Single Sign-On
                authentication portals. A momentary lapse in judgement may leave your data entirely exposed to a threat actor. 
            </p>
            <h4>Preventitive Measures</h4>
            <p>While P@$$w0rd123! may at a glance appear to meet the requirements of a strong password, it is only a slight variation on one of the most
                popular passwords around: password123. If you have a moment of doubt, google the most common passwords for the current year and verify 
                if yours is a close match to any others. Include a variety of characters and keep it above 8 characters at a minimum. For those who 
                act as administrators for a large number of computers, set a policy that mandates password complexity to prevent this problem. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Dictionary Attack</h3>
            <p>Rather than attempt to guess every single possible combination, this attack leverages a knowledge of the psychology 
                of everyday users. With so many passwords to remember, it can be tempting to choose a word that is simple to remember
                and we believe that surely no one would guess. Attackers in this scenario will compile a new list of guesses from a 
                dictionary and automate the computer to attempt every word in the list. It is important to note that even words in your
                non-native language can still be guessed using this method. 
            </p>
            <h4>Preventitive Measures</h4>
            <p>The key to stopping an attack of this nature is to get creative! Interweave symbols and numbers in your passwords so that
                to a human reader it would look like a word we know (e.g. S0cC3Rb@11) but would not appear anywhere in a dictionary. Always
                keep in mind that if the password is convenient for you, it probably will be for the attacker as well. 
            </p>

        <div>
            <h3>Credential Stuffing</h3>
            <p>While it is very unfortunate, the truth about the world today is that data breaches are still a fairly common occurence.
                We would like to believe when setting up our username and password for an account that the hacker posseses no information
                about us. The reality is that our data may have already been lost in a previous data breach and through one means or another
                the hacker has acquired our usernames, passwords, or other personal information. This attack relies on the tendency that we
                have to use the same passwords for multiple accounts. This attack will prove to be devastating for those who rely on unvaried
                credentials. One tool that you can use right now to determine if your information has been involved in a data breach can be
                found at <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">this site</a>. Please note that this is not a comprehensive list and you should
                still take proper precautions. 
            </p>
            <h4>Preventitive Measures</h4>
            <p>The best way to avoid being exploited via this attack method is to vary the passwords that you use on various accounts.
                Perhaps the most important account to secure with a totally unique password is your email. If an attacker is able to access
                your email, they will have the key to resetting your passwords for any accounts that are linked to it. Keep up to date on current
                events, if a company that you are associated with reports a data breach, it is best to act fast and change your passwords to prevent
                any potential threats.

        <div>
            <h3>Birthday Attack/Collision Attack</h3>
            <p>This attack requires a basic understanding of the Birthday paradox. This paradox states that in a room of 23 people, there is a 50-50
                chance that two people will share the same birthday. However, in a room of 75 individuals, those odds jump to 99.9%. It's very difficult for
                us to comprehend the likelihood of this happening, and that is exactly that attitude that this attack exploits. If you would like
                to explore the nitty gritty mathematics of the paradox, you can do so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem" referrer="blank">here.</a> 
                It is also important that you know what a cryptographic hash is. If you are unfamiliar, you can read up on the subject 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function" referrer="blank">here.</a> Rather than birthdays, this method is based on
                the idea that 2 different plaintext values will produce the same cryptographic hash (called a collision). Knowing this makes the brute force 
                process for a hacker easier to execute. Daniel Miessler explains much more elegantly in <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/study/birthday_attack/" referrer="blank">this</a>
                article. 
            </p>
            <h4>Preventitive Measures</h4>
            <p>Unfortunately for the standard user, there is not much action that can be taken to prevent the execution of this type of attack. Not to fear,
                as long as your designated security professional knows their stuff, they will have the necessary tools to decrease the likelihood of a successful
                birthday attack. When a cryptopgraphic hash is created, salt can be added to deter this type of exploitation. Salt is a mix of random values that
                are added to the hash so even in the event of a collision, the randomly added values will ensure that the 2 hashes no longer appear to be the same
                and the attacker cannot immediately draw any easy conclusions. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Rainbow Table Attacks</h3>
            <p>Imagine that your password has been stored in a database as a cryptogrpahic hash (an irreversible process), even if the hacker is able to steal said 
                database, your information is safe right? Not exactly. Much like a dictionary attack, the hacker will build their rainbow table by hashing entries
                from the dictionary or from lists of commonly used passwords. Now the hacker has an entire database of hashed values to use to compare with the captured
                hashes from your password database! 
            </p>
            <h4>Preventitive Measures</h4>
            <p>To keep yourself safe in this instance, we go back to the basics. Avoid using passwords that are simple and that would be found in a dictionary or commonly
                used password list. Complexity and length are always a solid first step in ensuring your safety. Secondly, the individuals who are managing the security
                of your database should include salt in the hashes. By sprinkling randomized values into the hash, even a weak password won't match any of the precomputed 
                values in the rainbow table of the attacker and they will be forced to result to other methods.
